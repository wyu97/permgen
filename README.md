# Sentence-Permuted Paragraph Generation

This repository will contain the code package and output examples of the paper:

**[Sentence-Permuted Paragraph Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07228.pdf)**


In this paper, we propose a novel framework PermGen whose objective is to maximize the expected log-likelihood of output paragraph distributions with respect to all possible sentence orders. PermGen uses hierarchical positional embedding and designs new procedures for training, and decoding. Experiments on three paragraph generation benchmarks demonstrate PermGen generates more diverse outputs with a higher quality than existing models.


## Output examples
We currently only demonstrate the output examples on the ROCStories dataset. The paper is currently under review. We will release our code upon acceptance.
